# 3D Game Console Museum (Unity VR)

### Overview

Created in 2023, the 3D Game Console Museum is a virtual reality experience that showcases the history of 3D game consoles. Each room in the museum represents a different generation of consoles, featuring detailed information about their features, impact, and success. This project made extensive use of Unity's Virtual Reality (VR) capabilities, incorporating technologies such as occlusion culling, baked lighting, and Level of Detail (LOD) to enhance performance and immersion. Careful measures were also taken to minimize memory fragmentation, ensuring smooth performance throughout the experience.

### Development & Features

Developed in Unity with Virtual Reality (VR) support. Accomplishments included:

- Optimized for performance using occlusion culling to improve rendering efficiency and baked lighting to enhance visual quality.
- Implemented LOD (Level of Detail) models for console pedestals, reducing resource usage while maintaining visual fidelity at various distances.
- Focused on memory optimization, using techniques to prevent memory fragmentation for smoother gameplay.
- Integrated menus tailored for the VR experience, allowing players to interact with interfaces intuitively in a 3D environment.
- Designed a unique cursor system using a blue cylinder, enabling players to walk around the museum and interact with consoles.
- Developed interactive pop-up billboard GUIs that appear when the player approaches a console, providing detailed information about each console's features and historical significance.

### Real-World Applications

This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in VR development using Unity, while focusing on performance optimization, UI/UX design in VR, and integrating dynamic interactions. It also helped me further hone my skills in handling 3D assets, including LOD models, and understanding how to efficiently manage resources in large-scale virtual environments.
